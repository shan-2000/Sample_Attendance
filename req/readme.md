# ATTENDANCE AUTOMATION USING PYTHON:

# INTRODUCTION :
An automatic attendance system is an educational ERP system that records the students' attendance in an institution. Unlike the conventional attendance system, 
the automatic attendance software enables the faculty to record, store, and monitor students' attendance history & manage the classroom efficiently.
If you’re a business that believes your employees are your most precious asset, then you’ll do everything in your power to make sure their work informs how your business operates. Tracking employee time and attendance is one of the best tools in your toolbox for improving productivity and efficiency. 
Gone are manual timekeeping systems that are prone to tedious timesheet review and payroll errors. Today’s modern companies are using advancements in timekeeping technology to keep track of employees’ work hours and are taking advantage of the benefits of time and attendance management systems to take their businesses to the next level. 

## Objective:
### - Goal of a project
 Automating  attendance system ,calculating percentage using python 
 * You all must have worked with Excel at some time in your life and must have felt the need for automating some repetitive or tedious task.
 * Openpyxl is a Python library that provides various methods to interact with Excel Files using Python. It allows operations like reading, writing, arithmetic operations, plotting graphs, etc.
 * pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
 * Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. ... Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code. 
 * Reading from Spreadsheets
 * Reading from Multiple Cells
 * Writing to Spreadsheets
 * sorting form spreadsheets
 * Arithmetic Operation on Spreadsheet(adding , mean calculation )
 * Adjusting Rows and Column
 * filtering and concat

## High level requirements
### - Describes a set of capabilities which a project under consideration must achieve

|HLR ID|Description|Implemented/Future|
|------|-----------|------------------|
|HLR_1|When ever driver is drowsy, an alarm needs to be triggered|Implemented|
|HLR_2|When Vehicle catches fire, windows need to be opened automatically|Implemented|
|HLR_3|If driver consumes alcohol,vehicle has to be automatically stop|Implemented|
|HLR_4|If the GSM module get failure it need not send messages|Future|
|HLR_5|Heart beat sensor very much need for heart patient,workers of thermal station and fire service workers|Future|
|HLR_6|Incase if heart beat rate is too high of passengers or person inside vehicle due to anxiesty attack the gsm module has to respond immediately by sending message|Future|


## Low level requirements
### - Specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish in order to meet the high-level software requirements

|LLR ID|Description|Implemented/Implemented|

|LLR4_HLR_2|After taking the input from fire sensor, windows control has to open the windows|Implemented|
|LLR1_HLR_3|A alcohol sensor conneted to the microcontroller continuosly moniter the alcohol presence in vehicle|Implemented|
|LLR2_HLR_3|If the alcohol gas  detected then it gives input to the ignition relay|Implemented|
|LLR3_HLR_3|Than ignition relay has off so the vehicle stoped automatically|Implemented|
