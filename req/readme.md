# ATTENDANCE AUTOMATION USING PYTHON:

# INTRODUCTION :

* An attendance management system is a technique for keeping track of your employees' working hours. You can do that by using tracking software, spreadsheets, punching time cards, and more.
* An automatic attendance system is an educational ERP system that records the students' attendance in an institution. Unlike the conventional attendance system, 
the automatic attendance software enables the faculty to record, store, and monitor students' attendance history & manage the classroom efficiently.
* If you’re a business that believes your employees are your most precious asset, then you’ll do everything in your power to make sure their work informs how your business operates. 
* Tracking employee time and attendance is one of the best tools in your toolbox for improving productivity and efficiency. 
Gone are manual timekeeping systems that are prone to tedious timesheet review and payroll errors. 
* Today’s modern companies are using advancements in timekeeping technology to keep track of employees’ work hours and are taking advantage of the benefits of time and attendance management systems to take their businesses to the next level. 

## Objective:
### - Goal of a project
 Automating  attendance system ,calculating percentage using python 
 * You all must have worked with Excel at some time in your life and must have felt the need for automating some repetitive or tedious task.
 * Openpyxl is a Python library that provides various methods to interact with Excel Files using Python. It allows operations like reading, writing, arithmetic operations, plotting graphs, etc.
 * pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
 * Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. ... Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code. 
 * Reading from Spreadsheets
 * Reading from Multiple Cells
 * Writing to Spreadsheets
 * sorting form spreadsheets
 * Arithmetic Operation on Spreadsheet(adding , mean calculation )
 * Adjusting Rows and Column
 * filtering and concat

### Manual vs Automated Attendance System

There are two kinds of attendance system a company can choose from, i.e. manual or automated. The traditional attendance tracking method includes punch locks or some other sort of manual system. However, this method requires consistent human supervision. But fortunately, the evolving technology has led to the introduction of the automated attendance system that provides much better results. 

One can use either of these systems for maintaining the attendance record of the employees; however, just like every coin, there’s a good and bad side to both. It is because of this reason that most of the companies get confused and are unable to decide whether they should use an automated or a manual attendance system. 

### Automated Attendance System – Pros and Cons:
* Provides accurate results
* Helps in administrative tasks
* Saves money, improves the productivity of the employees
### Manual Attendance System- Pros and Cons 
* Possible human errors
* Speed
