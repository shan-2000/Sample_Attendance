 * You all must have worked with Excel at some time in your life and must have felt the need for automating some repetitive or tedious task.
 * Openpyxl is a Python library that provides various methods to interact with Excel Files using Python. It allows operations like reading, writing, arithmetic operations, plotting graphs, etc.
 * pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
 * Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. ... Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.

### Manual vs Automated Attendance System

There are two kinds of attendance system a company can choose from, i.e. manual or automated. The traditional attendance tracking method includes punch locks or some other sort of manual system. However, this method requires consistent human supervision. But fortunately, the evolving technology has led to the introduction of the automated attendance system that provides much better results. 

One can use either of these systems for maintaining the attendance record of the employees; however, just like every coin, there’s a good and bad side to both. It is because of this reason that most of the companies get confused and are unable to decide whether they should use an automated or a manual attendance system.
